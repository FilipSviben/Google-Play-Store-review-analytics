Collections (i.e. favorites) management is terrible. No way to sort collected places by nearest distance from current location or even alphabetically. No way to edit a place once set, meaning you can't even rename a place after you save it. And in many instances you are not even allowed to set the name of the place when initially saving it. This leads to a same-name problem (such as two Targets, two Walmarts, etc.), and since you can't sort your collections list, two totally different locations look exactly the same in the same list, forcing you to load each individually and check just to see where they are. Different map themes are desperately needed because the two offered (day and night) do not have enough contrast for driving use, especially for day driving. The map lines and directional arrow also need to have thicker outlines. While the top and bottom bar text is done right with big, thick, bold fonts, the map itself does not get the same treatment where all street name text is tiny, road lines are skinny and proper contrast for driving use simply isn't there. Adjusting the phone's screen resolution, text size and screen zoom doesn't help with this at all (believe me, I tried). When using text-only directions while driving (start a route, tap top text bar to show full screen text directions), the list of directions does not update itself after taking a turn. After taking a turn, the last direction at top of the list should leave, and all directions scroll up to display the next turn at top of the list. This doesn't happen, making the text-only list while driving useless. If that list actually updated itself after each turn, this would be a *fantastic* feature. There should be a way to use Speed Alerts with visual cue only with no sound. Instead you have an ""all or nothing"" option where if enabled, over-limit speed turns red and a double-tone (which cannot be customized) is heard. It would be very nice to turn that sound off and only see the visual cue. When viewing a collected place's details, it should show everything, including the GPS coordinates. It doesn't. The only way to see a collected place's coordinates is to share it as a text message, and in the URL you actually see the coordinates there. Very wonky workaround just to get this info. There is the ability to creation a home location shortcut icon outside of the app by long pressing the home icon. This is great. Unfortunately, that's the only shortcut you can create. It would be nice to create a shortcut for any collected place.","en",17,NA

So I started driving this year and I like to listen to music while doing so, but the constant voice prompts are really ennoying. Id like to see an options to turn them off completely, because with the current ""option"" it resets every time you launch the app. So i have to uninstall it and get annoying pop ups and dont have the option of enabling it on the go (50mb download, making the offline maps obsolete^^) Also id like to see an option to avoid certain roads, e.g. i havent got a ""vignette"" for austria, so i cant use their highways. Also a start, via point x, destination would be nice. This could also serve as help for the before mentioned problem, since right now i have to start guidance to a point not on the highway first, when i reach it i have to pull over only to enter my final destination and check if it sends me over a highway. So like avoid highways for certain countries switch would be aswesome! Last improvement would be the search. If im currently in a city and just type in a street, i dont want to see an option across the country, but cant even see the street where im at until i type the cities name too. Same for searching cities that are close to me, if im in germany and type lindau i dont want to get guidance to some small town in switzerland, but id prefere the city in the country im currently at.

Offer an option to import addresses to the collection from a text file. At the moment, I have to search every address and add to the collection one by one. Text import feature can check the addresses for their validity at the time of import. Also add an option to sort the addresses. 4. Not exactly sure if red camera detection is offered. If it does, any option to update those cameras? 5. Pls offer an option to have your own POIs (for offline use). 6. Offer an option NOT to re-route. 7.

It looks nice, is simple to use and generally picks routes well. Unfortunately, when it wants to download maps, it requires you to download the entire England map at 1.1gb - Then when it does updates it seems to download a large file again. Even on a home wifi that would be problematic if there are frequent updates, but on a mobile data plan that's simply unacceptable. Given that I use it for about 50 miles around me the fact that isn't an option to limit the map download makes it unusable in the car - It also doesn't let me sign in for some reason (my car head unit has a unusual resolution and I think it misses showing the login button. It then randomly turns on a voice (and forces you to download one) even when I never want voice navigation in the car. Finally, it won't let you start up in driving mode, which would be very handy in a car head unit for when you don't want to input a destination but do want traffic on your route displayed.

Even when I delete & re-install the Apps the Apps still crashed when I set the default data location to SD card. The only way that I could make the Apps work again was to manually delete the data on my SD card and download all the maps again. My advice to anyone using this Apps to delete your old maps data and reload the maps rather than to update your maps. Recently I had some problems with the apps when one of the major road was blocked in Germany - the apps keeps redirecting me back to the blocked road. In the end I had to switch off the auto navigation and used the apps as a map to by-pass the road block. I would have given it 5 stars if not for the fact that maps storage defaults to phone memory instead of ExtSdCard - and the only way it seems that it can be moved to the SD card is to delete the maps, set download to ExtSdCard and download the maps all over again (and that could take quite some time as the files are huge) - Plus the 44MB+ app cannot be moved to the SD card, making it not suitable for phones with small internal memory.","en",0,NA

In January, 2019 I installed a Pumpkin Android 8.1 Car Radio-Navigation device in my car.    Here WeGo installed with no problems and I used it until I received a message that there was a June 5 update.   I updated my telephone with no problems and then my Car Nav.   Here WeGo would not open.   After doing all of the usual maintenance activities like uninstall-reinstall, cleaning of caches, etc, there was no joy.   I contacted the WeGo company.  I promptly received an email with help suggestions that I had done before contacting them.   Finally, the representative told me that Here WeGo was designed for smart phones ONLY and was not designed for use in a dedicated car navigation system., and would not be available for more assistance.     I believe this is a valuable GPS Nav app and I also believe that there is a simple solution to my problem.   When this app works, my opinion is that it is one of the best.

It is offline, that is the only reason I keep it installer, so there is one map for so service areas. But as a navigation turn-by-turn system it is useless. And every update it keeps getting worst. Good navigation, driving a 2 ton car at 65mph is a serious thing. Please sell this back to Nokia, they knew what they were doing. Or at least change the name of the app to a more descriptive name as ""Here wego - nose dive off a cliff"" navigation system. This is very serious, you cannot have a navigation system that you are ighting with all the time trying to fuss with when driving. It has to be intuitive and just do what the user wants in 2 or 3 clicks. But this app seems to be trying to be ""clever"", ""smart"".. so useless. It a map. Take me from point A to point B. Every time I have to use it I regret it. Thanks","en",0,"Hi,

you can change the map view to 3D, 2Ddir. of travel or 2D north at top. To do so, please open the settings after switching to drive mode &gt; select Map option &gt;Map orientation&gt; choose your preferred view.

Thanks,
Support Team"

Slow to start, freezes, stops recognising when you have the offline maps downloaded. Also there is no voice navigation if you connect your phone to car via Bluetooth. This has always been something Here has claimed is not possible but my last windows phone was able to use voice navigation on my previous car when connected to Bluetooth. This may, however, have been Microsoft who fixed that as it was the Microsoft maps version at that time. Waze got around the voice navigation problem by using the phone's internal call system which still works through the phone speaker when connected to car by Bluetooth. Why can't Here do that?? I now use Waze as my main sat nav and Here is relegated to a back up app.","en",25,NA

Using it in the car, with my 8"" tablet, is a bit mixed feeling. It's ok during actual tracking, but what happens when I do a search? --It switches to portrait mode!!! ...which forces me to type sideways!!! HERE, obviously assumes that all devices are installed vertically in a car, but that is not practical, nor safe, for other devices than mobile phones. I happen to use a tablet, which is securely installed above the info-screen. I cannot turn the device, unless I release it from the clamp. Since most(all) other screens and applications follow the tilt-sensor for aligning the screen, why can't you do the same? Reading other reports regarding the same issue, and HERE's non-commitment regarding it, I realise that the application is unfit for car navigation and is uninstalled. I'll keep it for navigating around cities by foot, however.","en",8,NA

in terms of ease of use. Routing is acceptable, not Google quality but 
passable. Nevertheless there are significant problems that keep me from 
adopting it: A deeply neglected ""community"" of volunteer mappers whose 
edits never seem to make it to production and pretty much zero corporate 
engagement. A very cruddy map interface that does not allow a user to turn 
on satellite imagery during a route. Bad gyro predictives that give an 
almost drunk, lurching feeling to the map as opposed to Google's smooth as 
butter gyro interpolation. It's not awful but needs a lot of work and some 
serious effort to engage its community.","en",2,NA

Although it worked offline somewhat, it didn't work well and I walked many more miles than necessary, many more. Maybe it wasn't able to make a strong connection to gps when needed? It also sometimes stopped working suddenly and completely disappeared. Not a good thing when you're in an unfamiliar city. The small green indicator of my location  didn't clearly show the direction I was walking was part of the problem. Another is that the verbal command to turn left, right, wherever, wasn't timely, it told me to turn before or after where I needed to turn.  Hence the additional miles I had to walk. Maybe if my location indicator more clearly showed the direction I was walking, I could have seen by the map where to turn. It also would have been really helpful to be able to bring up a city and see all of my saved points of interest, with labels, and my location on the map. Often, I didn't know where I was in a city but wanted to know  where I was and the closest point of interest, such as the closest Starbucks, but the app just doesn't do that.","en",2,NA

It still works great for everything (but telephony, of course). So I thought I'd try using at as a GPS with HERE WeGo, which had good reviews.  I downloaded the maps for several surrounding states (the full US map is more than 6 gb), then took it out for a spin. The map directions worked perfectly, except for when I got to an area where recent major road work moved some intersections and roads around.  The only reason I give this 4 stars out of 5 is that the nice British lady who now lives in my phone would only say to turn here or go straight there, but not actually say the names of the roads.  I assume that is due to the developers going a little light on the speech synthesis by having her not even try to pronounce names along the route.  On a major trip, not saying the road name (as in, ""In 100 feet turn left onto Bo Diddley Avenue"" vs. ""Turn left in 100 feet"") could cause one to make a mistake because while driving you can't really look at the map.

r...Full ReviewBeen using this instead of Google Maps for a bit now, and never going back. 
Works with instructions for public transport, walking, bike riding etc as 
well as driving. Suggested routes are better (for me) over long distance 
country drives, with support for routes including or not including dirt 
roads, ferries, toll roads, and more. Seems to pick up GPS signals quicker 
in the city, and most importantly, will keep navigating if GPS signal isn't 
accurate due to obstructions, while signalling that the signal is no longer 
100% accurate. I like knowing where it thinks I am, and simultaneously 
knowing that the GPS signal is currently weak. As always, just letting the 
user know is the best UX. Very quick to re-route if you miss a suggested 
turn. I always have it on when driving for the speed alerts (a feature 
Google Maps currently misses entirely). Finally, privacy is much better. 
You can use the traffic option to see what the traffic is like, which 
includes sending your own information off to their servers to also help 
other users, but it's anonymised and to a company who cares about keeping 
your information private. And if you're not comfortable with even that, 
then there's nothing stopping you from turning off the traffic feature, 
which stops your data for traffic being sent off. So far I've had no issues 
with this app on my tablet. For sure, this is my new navigation app for 
good.","en",7,NA

Google maps doesn't have this accuracy, it can give directions and navigate 
well but it lacks the precise pinpointing of Here we go. The inconvenience 
with Here is that although it can show you which direction you're facing 
when you're just exploring the map, it locks on to a direction when you 
have set a waypoint and doesn't show you which way you're facing. Which is 
annoying when you need to know which direction you're starting from.

I work on OSM a lot and the guys that originally built it didn't plan for it to be used as a satnav.  For example, it is common to be told to do a U turn on a dual carriageway when the lanes merge into a single carriageway.

First, I used to use it to bike and walk around cities and the navigation instructions would come over my headphones or Bluetooth.

Google owes me three and a half euros. I will not forget. ever) plus, here always displays my current speed and the current speed limit. top free sat nav","en",2,NA

Great voice guidance, little interference with driving, be very fast rerouting in case of missing a turn.  However, the two most important features that I find lacking is (a) no lane assistant and (b) landscape support only in navigation screen, everything else is forced to portrait.  A highly annoying ""feature"" is the fact that it constantly keeps signing the user out if the device is powered off or offline for a few days. For the signing in again, the user needs to re-type BOTH email address and password. Can't it at least preserve the email address when feeling the need to have the login time out? In addition, this stupid auto-popup ""Getting Around"" is pretty much nothing I care about. I'm driving by car, not by the public transport lines it suggests. At least allow me to set preferences for stuff to show up there. Also, unfortunately, the app can't make use of Android adoptable storage (installs internally only, can't change map storage to SD card).","en",2,NA

It started losing GPS signal after newest updates. I know signal is excellent because I can use other programs fine. Also, I need to use it in landscape mode and you can't even enter to settings in landscape mode.

But the maps in my area  still display old shops/ landmarks from a year or more ago. Also the green circle on pedestrian navigation is nowhere near the blue line of the route to take. It used to be bang on the line and stayed there without drifting. Finally, when driving, the arrow seems to lag and is always slightly behind where your vehicle actually is.

I tried it out today and found it actually  worked better than my sat nav. Very impressed.  The only downside is that the volume on my phone is not as loud so I  do have to turn my radio off. But no cables and upto date maps!  May try plugging my phone into a speaker. Well impressed.","en",2,NA

I previously used a version on a Windows phone was better but recent upgrades on the Android version are making it more like the Windows version. One big disappointment is the fact that the app no longer allows storage of maps on SD card but instead saves them to internal memory on the device. This has recently led to an issue where I could not upgrade the system software on my device as it said there was insufficient memory available. I have had to remove my maps to apply the upgrade and then try to reinstall the maps. For some reason the map downloads are only getting to about 2% and then hang. I have managed to download the UK map after multiple attempts over several days. If Here can resolve problem of storing maps on SD card again then I would give the app a higher rating.","en",5,NA

It took me several times to such a routes and such a roads, that was totally illogical and I would not have called that a road (even unpaved road was disabled).

I like that this app offers offline navigation and speed limit warnings. And it seems better from a privacy perspective than Google maps.  That, however, is where the praise ends. This app is horrendously slow to takes for ever to load and search, and sometimes stops responding and crashes while I'm driving.  The lack of lane guidance and android auto integration are other major absences in the feature list.

Some of ...Full ReviewThere was a time when I used to prefer Here maps over Google, the main reason was offline navigation with other smaller things like more voice guidance options, 3D rendering of landmarks, etc.  Over a period of time, Google maps has improved tremendously and I feel this app lagging behind.  Some of the reasons why I prefer Google maps now are: 1. Much better mapping data, Here might have fully downloadable maps but what's the point if they take forever to update.  2. Google beats Here in traffic data accuracy and hence the ETAs on Here are way off the time that it actually takes to drive to any place.  3. There is no real time alternative faster route options given. (due to poorer) traffic data I think.  4. Bluetooth implementation could be better.

It was very important to have the option to find tourist attractions, museums, markets, many services etc. because with that the application will be very useful to use it for offline tourism and everyday navigation. Also another thing that missed is the option to organise a trip and put in one navigation many points. Last you must give options to voice guide also in another languages as Greek to listen the street names and to show on the screen sings especially when you are on highways. Also I need to listen louder and have voice option about the speed limits attention. Another minus is that I don't have the option to decide the type of the driving between short, speed and optimised. Last but not least for today it will be very useful to have the possibility to see your position with details of sat details. Just take everything that you had on Nokia Maps and upgrade them. Don't take them off. I hope that you take seriously my suggestion and I wish to see all of these to your next updates!","en",0,NA

The maps are bit sparse in respect of detail, but this is not necessarily a bad thing as it keeps the clutter and confusion down. The offline feature seems to work really well.

Was using Navimaps for over two years. But with latest updates couldnt store the offline maps on external sd card drive. So, to free up my phone's rom i switched over to here maps. Now I can store maps on sd card. They are huge ... 2.5 Gb for whole India. Whereas it was only 1.2 Gb in Navimaps. I guess Here map contains more details. Routes are pretty accurate with lots of markers. Still, would love to get periodic updates for the maps, so they continue growing in coverage, accuracy and details. Another feature I liked was to get sattelite view of the map from inside the app itself (requires data connection though).  Finally, I will like to say Thank you here maps for making life easier for those of us who travel a lot and to distant places.

Still since the update it constantly crashes on launch on my Samsung S5. It's great it is free but I would rather pay for it because I don't understand why a navigation app needs acces to my contacts, sms log and phone Nr.     Since the change of the developer of the app the updates for the offline maps always get stuck around 60% and I can't acces my collections, nor create new ones.  Now after the last updated, it can't find routes offline. If I find the route online then it works offline as well.  I personally find all the new features too much. They just make the app too large and clunky. Could you have a lighter version with just car and bike navigation that works offline?  How large are the map update files?

I did my recent holiday in Europe using the here maps. Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels and Luxembourg, besides a few places like Ghent and Bruges.   I did not know any streets or roads in these cities. Here maps took me to the precise location either in walk mode or by car.   On one occassion the taxi driver lost his way in Brussels and used Here maps to reach my destinantion. On another occassion google maps got the destination all wrong and Here maps to the rescue.   Kudoos to the team. Highly recomended for all users. It's one app everyone must have.","en",12,NA

Even during off line mode, the results are very accurate.  I was able to find popular attractions by searching the attraction names. I have searched by address and the routes came right up.  This is one feature that many other off line maps don't do well as the apps can't locate the address when in off line mode. The entire US map takes about 6GB.  I guess this is what make this app more accurate than the other apps as other apps are between 1 to 2 GB file size, the larger the file size, the higher the accuracy. Unless, you have a high storage phone or have the ability to store files on a micro SD card, the large file size could be a problem.  I have a Honor 5X, and the phone allows me to store map data on the SD card and it worked out quite well.    Anyway, this is a life saver for road warrior like me.  I feel much more prepare and at ease now that I know I can find my way around at the no cell site areas.","en",14,NA

Clients properties and showings grouped in different Collections.  Only real problem I've had was a late 2014 update that caused collections to not load.   But, now, with it installed on two different Moto Z Force Droids, it causes the GPS location to jump to different locations (200-500 yards away).  It is not consistent.  Sometimes it locks steady, sometimes it jumps.  If I uninstall the software, GPS location locks on and stays. The Moto's have Android 7.0.","en",40,NA

Overall, this seems very good, but there is no way to do waypoints so I can make a custom route, which I do on pretty much every trip. In theory, the online web map supports syncing routes to the app, but in actuality, that doesn't work either. So the web map is awesome at the desk, but useless for phone navigation.  Google maps remains the only viable option I've found and it doesn't support offline maps.

Not sure how bad it's going to get but if it's going to be all downhill for this great map service if it gets worse. ADS, AD BANNERS etc are things that will ruin the look and feel of this service. Time will tell.  For now, still a great option to have if a navigation service is what your looking for. The ability to be alerted once you reach a certain speed is something this had for a while. But that AND the app to show you what the speed limit is is a huge pro. Not all nav services show or tell you what the speed limit is. This does, and it's one of my favorite features. That and the accurate maps of course.  Inside building navigation is something else I look forward to expanding and growing.","en",91,NA

Recalculation of the route is much faster than in any other app of it's kind.  While it does it's job quite well, there is one major flaw: You cannot export/import POIs without big hazzle.

An impressive number of POIs and quite good building coverage in major cities. Minimal interface makes it fairly easy to use and speed limit warnings are a helpful addition. Map Creator (web only) allows submitting changes that are (eventually) reviewed by Here experts and then get added to the new map release. Glympse support is also included, so you can share your location with somebody. *** Cons: If you live outside of a major city, you will most likely have no buildings rendered around, making your travel in a field of nothingness with POI markers a mile away from their actual locations. While Here knows about turn lanes and destination signs, they won't display this in the application (probably, to avoid competition with their clients - Garmin, iGO in the US, Sygic for trucks, Telenav for in-car navigation).

The routing also seems to have gotten slightly worse - frequently it guides me to an end-point that is 1/4th mile away from the actual destination. The publisher needs to bring back the lost functionality.   ***************** My Previous (2015) review:  App can be used in both online and offline mode. Complete country maps can be downloaded before travel, eliminating the need for expensive roaming plans for mobile data. Also, since a cellular data connection is not needed, you can get navigation coverage even in out-of-the way places. Finally, routing is rather good and this solution replaces a dedicated navigation unit. I would even be willing to pay for this if it were to be no longer free. One suggestion - please integrate this app with ""Contacts"".","en",9,NA

For example ""take the exit"" may put you onto a six lane exit, 3 left, 1 straight, 2 right. It's not until the last 100 yards that you get ""Turn right/left"". Across 5 lanes of traffic and the signal queue? Sure... Then after the left/right onto a 5 lane boulevard you get ""Turn left/right in 300 feet"". Uh-huh, across 4 lanes of traffic...  The appropriate instruction should be ""Take the exit, then turn right/left at the traffic light, then turn left/right in 100 yards.""  Oh, and The Voice will frequently forget how to say any distance, so the instruction might be ""In _____ miles take the exit."" Could be 1 mile or 200.  Unless you are a daredevil that keeps one eye on the phone and one eye on traffic, this app is a dangerous POS.","en",0,NA

I downloaded the whole of Iceland to my phone and it worked offline without any trouble whatsoever. I picked out all the places we wanted to see in advance and stored as favorites. Once I thought that it was taking me a long way round so I went the way I thought we should be going but it was correct, It was a dirt track which you are not insured to travel on. It even picked out two speed cameras (bit surprised they were any in Iceland). Only thing that's missing, and I find it really useful in the UK on my usual app, is an indication of any delays on your route.

While they added functions with limited use (like car sharing search), quality control has gone down the gutter. Be prepared that every update may break something.

Now after an update, downloading new maps doesn't work any more.   UPDATE 10/10/16: According to other sources the re-branding broke the update path, I uninstalled and reinstalled the app and then re-downloaded all maps.

When docked in car, the tablet is always in landscape move, starting up the HERE maps app, i came to realise that the Application forces itself to be portrait when inputting and selecting your destination.  Where as this is not something that would make me stop using the app, it is rather annoying.. making me either undock the tablet or tilt my neck in order to use the application properly before starting my journey   The inclusion of a landscape mode when inputting destinations would definitely make this a 5 star review, but without that inclusion I am afraid i will have to down grade to 4 stars","en",0,NA

It's my constant go to navigation tool, even when I'm out of signal range, it's no bother as the entire UK map system is in my SD card!

It has great coverage info of even the most remote areas of the UK, which I depend on while out traveling in the wilds.  The only constructive criticism I have so far, is it confuses itself with a couple of junctions to come off the M25 (south of Dartford crossing), the voice prompt gives incorrect info, while the map stays true.
