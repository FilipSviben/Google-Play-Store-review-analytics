Incredible how many idiots complain about details in the maps, and how they think the ""navmee team"" should fix it, thinking this is a billion dollar company, acting like they paid for maps and not understanding the concept of open street maps, or anything else about this great open source community project. Navfree - the original - is also great, I actually like the interface better, but I use Navmee because of the HUD. These two has never led me astray, with the intergrated google search they can find absolutely everything, and if you find a thing in a map to update, you can do it yourself, I personally has never seen someting that wrong that I care to bother.

A little cumbersome to use but the functionality you need is usually there, if you can guess/remember where they hid it.

Fastest/shortest/economic selection, toggling the most common interest points parking lots/petrol/restaurants, et cetera Version 3.6.15 fixed the favourites that were severely messed up in the previous version - thanks.

Since upgrade to navmii the app seems to be very jumpy(GPS map seems to stutter) it is also a major battery killer even when charger is connected. Since my phone upgraded to android 5.0 navmii crashes constantly.  It just shuts off.  It also throws my account out and when I logged back in all my trips and miles driven and rating where erased.  Please fix these bugs so that Navmii is once again a top of the line navigation app.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<3.4.18 fixed a lot of the things I mentioned above but now the traffic and speed camera warnings have ceased to function.  When I scroll around the map in offline mode I see all the cameras but as soon as I hit the arrow to follow my position or start to navigate a route all cameras disappear. So I will upgrade to 4 stars fix these bugs to get 5 stars Latest update seems to have fixed none of the bugs reported. Back down to a 2 star rating<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<Updated on 17 OCT 2016.  don't see anything fixed, manually input speed cams still don't work, can have only 1 waypoint add more and the one input last is the only 1 that is shown in trip","en",12,"Hi,

But it can offer weird routes at times. Last year in London UK it got very confused, probably as there were many roads nearby, also it seemed to think we were driving on the right. So at a roundabout it said 1st exit, but it should be 3rd. But with a good passenger watching it and the road, it comes into its own. (Passenger shouts: don't listen to Kate, she's wrong!) I've downloaded appropriate maps when traveling abroad and they've been really helpful, but only with my wife watching. It has a problem locating some well-known places, doesn't like certain spellings. Tip: when using it bring a car charger & always keep it plugged in or the battery will drain. An annoying issue is that when the sun goes down the app also goes dark and it's harder to read. We have tried changing Settings - Display Preferences - Automatic Day/Night by ticking and unticking the box but it makes no difference. Here a tip to make it bright when you're traveling at night: adjust the tablet's time to daytime. You may also need to switch off and restart the tablet, at least that's what I have to do. If anyone can find an easier solution to this problem please let me know! Thanks","en",5,NA

For cars I give it a 4 out of 5.  For my motor bike it was worthless since Navmii didn't work once you switched off your screen and put your phone in your pocket. Not long ago I discovered a ""new"" feature: Navmii now keeps working after you switch off the screen! Now I can use it on my motor bike (just following directions through my earpiece).

reliable travelling companion for 5 years... [Amazing for a free SAT Nav

route at home over wi-fi. Switched off wi-fi and mobile internet on my 
phone. Ignored every direction Navfree gave me (I knew where I was going, 
so knew what alternative route to take). App updated directions *instantly* 
every time I went off-route (with, I repeat, *no* internet connection, so 
no data costs). I'm impressed. One or two teething problems with the May 
update seem to be sorted now, and this is still a great FREE Nav app, if a 
little flaky at times - struggles with, for example, Manchester's one-way 
system; doesn't recognise Blackburn, Lancashire in the town search (but 
give it as an option if you search for a road name)... Still the best free 
app I've used, and still amazing that they can produce something so good
