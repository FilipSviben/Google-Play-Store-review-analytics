This app has had its problems with navigation but the latest update has made it even worse!  Now when it starts, it stops in the middle of the title screen and goes dark. Restarting once or twice gets it started but it has then reset the voice guidance setting (even though the voice screen shows the correct voice chosen -  street name with turn by turn voice directions - but what you hear is the male no street name voice.  You find this out as you are driving and it starts giving voice directions, resulting in having to find a place to pull over and reset the voice.  As in the past this app routes the wrong way down one way streets, does not reroute around heavy traffic conditions, and RV routing only routes for restricted roads and puts the RV on roads no RV should be driving on.  The last trip with this navigating it took me right into hours of stopped traffic when there were alternative routes.  POIs are extremely limited. If the next update does not correct the starting and voice reset, this app is useless for navigation - for an RV or a car!

This ""improvement"" is not really better, just so Trimble MAPS knows. No contact from Trimble, even though I left a ticket. This used to be a great app, but the removal of RV settings along with road and speed preferences make it just another app. What funny is when you search for RV GPS app, this still shows up, even though you cannot actually use it for that.

However with the removal of the ability to specify road preferences it is now worse than useless to an RV driver. System assumes the driver is in a small car and routes accordingly. It is possible to edit the proposed route to force it to avoid certain roads but this is tedious in the extreme on a long run around country areas.

The best thing it does is make sure I dont take routes with low overpasses. LONG VERSION: Was merely disappointed until tonight. Before tonight, directions read aloud did not include additional information (e.g. ""take exit"" or ""stay left"" but no audible queue as to the exit direction, number, etc, or any details regarding the upcoming/next direction). I literally have to take my eyes off the road to make sure I'm following the directions properly. Providing map feedback is cumbersome: I shouldn't have to click 4+ options to enter ""wrong speed limit"" or ""speed trap"" when i'm driving. If I'm trying to be helpful, make it safe for me to do so, please. The most worthless feature is announcing ""point of interest"" without indicating what said point of interest might be or relative distance. All I know is something within a category I've marked of interest is within a certain distance I've selected. But tonight, all of that disappointment changed. Literally thought about hiring an attorney. App took me ""quickly"" south through Baltimore towards Alexandria... not only did it take me through a questionable part of Baltimore around midnight (state roads 40 & 295), but the roads were so bad I had to drive 20 MPH as the > $100k RV sounded like it was going to shake apart at 30 MPH and I hit almost every red light (making the trip through town longer). Eventually turned off CoPilot b/c I couldn't trust it to do anything sensible. Fortunately, I generally knew where I was going. Unfortunately, this isn't the first time the app decided to leave the generally better conditions, faster speeds and ""more acceptable area"" freeways and interstates offer but this is the first time the app made me furious to the point that I (1) turned it off (2) want my money back and (3) seriously think the incremental damage done to my RV by the ridiculous roads it recommends is a clear indication that developers/sellers of the app do not use it.","en",1,NA

I felt a bit mislead when I furst bought this but have since got used to it and now use it all the time. There are some issues with the maps I.e telling you to get of and then straight back on a motorway (M40J2) & depending what else your phone is doing can slow right down at complicated junctions. Traffic is extra but worth it (watch the price tho). It also works in London where even my TomTom struggles. Its a shame it can't only display when approaching a junction which would save battery.

While I still prefer the previous version better, I've tried just about every other Navigation app out there, and CP is still on top. My biggest complaint now is the occasional quirky routing. There are certain roads that the app just refuses to use even though they may be the most obvious (short & fastest)!  Just can't figure out why. I've tweaked the routing/vehicle profiles with some success, but still doesn't quite fix this.   But the app has a number of features that I can't find together in any other single app: -Multi-stop/waypoint route planning -Ability to download the entire N. America maps in less than 2.4gb -Fast route calculations with alternatives -Reads addresses from contacts -Customized vehicle routing profiles -On-line searching for POIs (although I miss Google over Yelp) -Active traffic -Broad selection of map colors & backgrounds -Ability to easily mute voice directions. -No annoying 'Re-calculating' every time I get off-route!  Now if ALK could work on the routing quirks, it would be almost perfect!","en",6,"We’re sorry to hear that you are unhappy with CoPilot.

The app is well worth the once in a lifetime price and has many more features than the dedicated GPS devices.  Unlike many apps, the maps are stored on the external memory device.   The maps are well maintained.  New roads are added in a timely fashion and are the most acurate I have seen.  The program gives the user many usefull navigation features and great control of the map display.  If users choose to participate, their paths are anonymously shared with CoPilot and used to update the roads.  All map updates are free and sent out often.  The Points of Interest are well maintained.  Most of what I have searched was found in the POIs.  The optional Active Trafic feature has saved me from many hours of waiting in rolling parking lots.

I'm planning a long trip and thought I would resurrect my copilot subscription and was considering whether to buy a year of active traffic. Then I discovered why I drifted away. Map updating is absolutely hopeless. For example, the update to the M8 into Glasgow was opened on the 23rd April 17.  It is now 1st September 17 and still no sign of the new motorway on the Copilot map. Obviously map updating is a low priority for CoPilot. Pleased I remembered why I drifted away and saved myself some money. I'll stick with a satnav (or 2) that keep their maps up to date.","en",2,"Hi Richard, I can see the update of the extension road in Here map (our provider).So, it will normally get updated automatically in our next map updates.

What i found out, though, is that CoPilot leaves you hanging as soon as you reach the last block. It's up to you to drive up and down the block, figure out the street numbers, and find where your target street number actually is. Another annoying ""feature"" is when CoPilot is telling you to ""TAKE EXIT"". OK, that's nice, but WHICH exit?  And is that an exit to the LEFT, or is it an exit to the RIGHT? There are both names and exit numbers on the map. And, lastly... ""TURN LEFT"" / ""TURN RIGHT""... That, again, is great, but what is the street called? Particularly critical if there are 2 streets immediately succeeding each other.","en",0,"Hi Luc, Thank you for your feedback.

If you are concerned about data usage with google maps you can from the menu download any part of map you want and store it on your phone.  I bought this app only to find i had to pay again! for the traffic data that would guide me round obstacles. So after spending nearly 30 quid I got myself a phone app that know less about the roads than google, tried to put me down one way roads the wrong way and was downright slow and awkward to read on the screen. It does not tell me how fast I am going unless it thinks i am speeding - no I'm not it's road speed limit data is inaccurate.  the colours on the screen are stupid, much of the time at junctions it looks like it is refusing to give you a route when what has happened is that the ""arrow"" is the same colour as the road and the tip of the arrow is off the side of the screen! completely ridiculous, to say that this app is rough around the edges is an understatement.  I am happily back on my free google maps and 30 quid out of pocket!  Oh and the lane guide images  do not depict the configuration of the junction - get waze","en",0,"Hi Simon, we’re sorry to hear that you are unhappy with CoPilot.

SHADEY & INCOMPETENT COMPANY! ### I forwarded them my confirmation email from Google (because it has ALL the details, order number etc) including with it screenshots with error codes proving that the add-on (traffic information) won't install, and this shadey company waited until 48hrs had gone before emailing me back asking what account I had used, even though I had given them all the details in my original email, just so Google won't give me a refund because it's gone over the 48hrs time limit! The night maps function doesn't work on any of my devices! I've tried it it with 4 different devices (2 phones and 2 tablets) so as to rule out it being a manufacturer or OS version issue. It's not, it just DOESN'T WORK! I keep getting notifications from this app saying CoPilot offer, 30% off, but when you click on it, it opens the app and there's just 20% off and only the traffic announcements! Disgusting click bait and lies! I've bought this app 3 times because of their BS licensing! So yes the app is good (used to be, IT'S MUCH BETTER ON APPLE'S IOS) but read on! The first time was with ""Gizmondo"" a standalone GPS unit which went bankrupt a year or so after release so there was NO lifetime free updates! The second was in 2009/10 for my iPhone as they wouldn't let me transfer my license from the first! The third is for my android as AGAIN, they wouldn't let me transfer my license from the iPhone! I was of the thinking of ""I'm not buying a new iPhone just for this app!"" But seeing as Google doesn't give a damn about its customers I was ready to change that thinking and buy the new iPhone X. But seeing as neither Google nor Apple pay their fair share in taxes, I'm no longer going to reward any of them! No more buying apps so they get interest and no more buying either of their phones! Once my smart devices die, I'm not getting any replacement! I've bought lifetime voice in addition to UK & Ireland maps and then I've upgraded to full European maps because I've bought a touring caravan to take to Europe, and NOW THEY WANT ME TO PAY FULL PRICE FOR THE CARAVAN VERSION! WHY DO I HAVE TO PAY FULL PRICE? ITS THE EXACT SAME AS THIS APP WITH THE ADDED BONUS OF ADDING THE SIZE OF THE CARAVAN! IF I BUY IT, THIS APP IS POINTLESS! I'VE ALREADY PAID OVER THE ODDS FOR THIS APP DUE TO PAYING FOR IT 3 TIMES OVER! WHY AREN'T YOU ADDING THE CARAVAN FEATURES TO THIS APP AS AN UPGRADE OPTION?

Prefer this to my dedicated Garmin satnav.  I have now changed my view on this app. Every so often they update it and the latest one is a disaster.

The latest update removed the only facility that set them apart from the many other apps, which is the OS grid reference option. The route reliability has never been the best (sends you 10miles out of your way instead of telling you to turn around when possible, to name just 1) but I put up with it because of OS grid. With out this feature, its really not worth the trouble. There are much better Sat navs with more reliable routes. I was forced in to using my 5 year old TomTom on the weekend. Also, Zero response from the developer over a number of platforms.  11/08/17 What has happened?? This worked great yesterday, now there's no option to use GB grid reference!!? 99% of the time I have to use GB grid, which is why I opted for Copilot. This app is now useless to me! Can I revert to the version I wanted? If not please provide a refund.","en",2,"Hello Orite. Thanks for your comment.
The option OS Grid Reference has been removed from CoPilot in the latest version. However, you can look online for a converter to convert OS Grid References to Latitude and Longitude Coordinates.

This is very unhelpful as you then have to risk touching your phone in a vehicle (points in the uk) or more so, stop and  remove gloves if your on a bike.. Very good app for bikers especially if you want to create or download your own routes. Various map creating options on the Web then download your route to copilot and away you go.  At £13 for the full version it sure beats the £400 cost of a Garmin or Tom Tom even when factoring in the cost of a cradle for phone. The app itself works very well (galaxy s5).","en",0,"Hi Nobby, thank you for contacting us.

Extra space for the traffic bar is a big help-- refresh button is big enough to push and the delay indicator at the bottom is more readable than before. But in 2d mode the route line is narrower than it was in v9, making it harder to see the traffic colors and sometimes even the route itself. It's also too easy to choose a color combination that is hard to read, perhaps partly due to the new blue color for the route. Would be nice if the 2d/3d switch were always available, not hidden in the menu -- although it looks cleaner now it's still the same number of clicks as before to toggle, which I still consider one click too many.  Despite that, no matter how many other apps I try, I keep coming back to CoPilot for the traffic info with minimal bandwidth usage and the ease of toggling between 2d overview and 3d modes. Although CoPilot could improve further, no other app comes closer to meeting my needs.","en",2,NA

It's fairly easy to use and set up, but I found a lot of road changes not on Copilot that had been made several years ago,  so the mapping is not very current.   In one instance,  a recommendation for an alternate route was through a wind mill facility on a dirt road.  The screen only allows two data points to be displayed,  ETA, speed, elevation, distance, remaining time,  or heading,  not a big deal, but more would be nice.  It's not a$400 GPS, so I guess you get what you pay for,  but current mapping is a necessity.","en",0,"Hello Dale, thanks for your comment. During this year we will release new map updates.

However... This latest update is a real mixed bag. I've got the hang of the new UI, and I like the new navigation layout when you're on the move,but I've had hangs in real time Nav when using multiple way points - it just doesn't like it and does not hang when it's a single destination. My biggest issue is I now have multiple favourite listings of the same address and also keep losing my home and work saved addresses - they just go. So I have to go into the menu and re save them. It's niggly and extremely annoying. If I could go back to version 9 or 8 I would, which I suppose says it all for the update.       Great app and have used it for a couple of years for my job.

Never in my years of smartphone apps have I encountered such a poorly written, infuriating, positively dangerous piece of software as this.  Turn instructions are either ridiculously in advance (like 17 miles) or so close to the junction that it's a wonder that accidents don't happen (they probably do, but I've been lucky so far)  Instructions are not clear and concise, instead they are normally overly verbose, when a two word phrase would have sufficed.   The app requires mobile data enabled on the phone otherwise it will randomly crash.  Even with data on, the app can just shut down, normally at the most inopportune moments. It comes with a warning to drive safely and not operate the phone while driving. Easier said than done when you're in a strange town and your only lifeline has decided to desert you.  Even when it does decide to work, you end up looking at the screen for far longer than is safe, for visual confirmation of your route, as the voice instructions are garbled.  I've really tried to like this app, and have given it every chance to prove itself, but I sadly have to say that my 13 year old TomTom Go still makes a far better job of directing me to my intended destination, than this abomination would ever know how to do, and that's with the TomTom maps woefully out of date.","en",1,"Hi Geoff,

There's nothing intuitive about the new version. The navigation screen is 30% smaller in landscape mode, thanks to the annoying vertical dashboard. You could at least give the user the option to go full screen. The nav screen can't be locked in landscape mode, and the option to mod the route by dragging it is gone. This was my go to gps app for motorcycle rides. Leave it to ALK to fix something that wasn't broken. I really HATE this app, I would give it zero stars if that were possible.

Just take a look at the user forums and you''ll see what I mean. Plus, they apparently replaced their entire online support site and it was impossible to get logged back in under my existing ID. As to the product, it's sluggish, the UI is big and ugly, there are few options to customize it, street names are microscopic and there are no real options to deal with the low contrast colors of maps. Trying to use ANY GPS while in traffic is inherently dangerous as it takes attention off the road, but this one is unnecessarily difficult to read. Oh yeah, it also does nothing but crash on my phone. Icing on the cake.","en",4,NA

Don't make the mistake of updating your apps just before a trip you've carefully planned, including all your saved stops along the way.  One clunky feature that seems to survive all updates is that when you try to save a location, you can either save the address, or, when you try to add an identifier, it wipes out the actual address. So when you're actually navigating, you don't know the address that the app is taking you to.  The latest update made such a radical change to the interface that it's now effectively a different app (with none of my saved addresses, I might add). And I don't consider it an improvement.  BTW, POI search is only marginally useful. Many prominent destinations aren't found, or can only be found if the name is entered exactly as it's in their database, which may not match reality.  My home address is on a major US highway, but the app doesn't understand that street addresses are based on how mail is delivered, and since I'm in a different county from my city's county, the app is lost. I suppose some would say that we shouldn't complain about free, but nothing is free.","en",1,"Hello, we’re sorry to hear you’re having problems.

I recently compared it to another satnav that I'd purchased previously and surprised to see the gaps between the two still remained and I was using the best product available. Key for me is the frequent and easy entry of addresses and the adding of waypoints - something that Copilot handles well.  Route planning is excellent, app stability great, updates are frequent and GPS accuracy is spot on. I do have a few niggles - but not enough to knock a star off.","en",0,NA

Even tried force stop, manual delete of it's Android/data folder; downloaded entire NA map :(  I've used free CoPilot for several years.  You have to 'recalculate' in order to see the next turn and the voice guidance is disabled until you go into the 'My CoPilot' menu and select 'Features and Upgrades' to purchase voice-navigation. I finally did this due to a trip to the USA and was pleasantly surprised to find it only cost CAD $10.44 and not the ~$30 price of the premium version.  It's now on par with an older model Garmin which suits my needs :)  I do find that viewing the screen is still required for most roundabout's and approaching some exits since the visual display is more accurate than voice directions.  New home areas are not on the map but that's not unexpected.  This has been my best purchase on Google Play store.

CoPilot allows you to control your battery usage: go to Settings &gt; Power Saving to set the option that you prefer.
Also, you may consider using the Directions View instead of the Map View during longer trips, which will save some power.

After years of flawless service it simply failed.  What did you do devs??  GPS dropouts, required multiple reboots of the phone.  Reliability was ZERO.  I had to buy a device to do the job this app used to do.  Recent experience was the download of the ENTIRE Europe map to get map data for Malta.  The app refused to use the SD card storage.  I tried repeatedly to download the map data.  I really did.  The download stalled time and time again.  Each time it succeeded (dozens of attempts) the app simply refused to accept that a map was present.  The simple fact is that it will NOT install maps to the SD card.  I tried three different cards.  I formated them, tried everything!  I spoke to customer service, who responded within 24 hours.  No help.  End game, app abandoned.  Uninstalled.  I simply couldn't make it work.  Such a shame.  It used to work really well.","en",0,"Hi Paul, We are sorry to hear about your problem with CoPilot.

Copilot does all this and the maps for my country seem fairly accurate so far. Only didn't award 5 stars due to frequent crashing on my Galaxy S6 while navigating menus etc. (hasn't crashed while on the road giving directions yet though). UPDATE after using it a few times:  1) If you are stupid wnough to hit delete on a saved trip plan by mistake, it will delete it without question or confirmation... should probably fix this! I lost a complex trip like this and had to re-input it  2) Would like a feature where each waypoint/stop point on a journey plan could show total distance / distance since last stop - useful for planning fuel stops on a long motorcycle ride.  Update 2: Seems I am now unable to use this as when I put a destination address in, it presents a blank screen with ""Multiple Cities Found"" and that's as far as I can get in entering an address. Don't know how to fix this so probably give this one a miss as I've seen other complaints about this same problem but no clearly defined resolution","en",0,"Hello, we’re always happy to hear suggestions on how to improve CoPilot.
