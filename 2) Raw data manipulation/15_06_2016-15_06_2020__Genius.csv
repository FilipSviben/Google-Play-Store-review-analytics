I love it a ton but wish for only a few updates: 1) Road names need match the road sign. Roads sometimes have two names (ex. I-88 and Regan Memorial Highway) but I need the signs and app to match, otherwise I keep glancing at my phone which leads to less attention to the road. 2) Turns after your current turn. For quick turn after another, being sure to merge and plan ahead properly. Otherwise, fantastic app!!","en",0,NA
