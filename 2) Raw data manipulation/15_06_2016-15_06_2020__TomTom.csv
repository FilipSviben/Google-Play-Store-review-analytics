The ""improvements"" have made it sluggish and prone to random crashes. Worst of all, my custom work POIs no longer sync with MyDrive, which renders it basically useless to me.

Also, if you accidentally turn on ""don't show me this again"" for clearing a route, you can very easily cancel navigation right when you need it, simply by brushing against the bottom of the display.

Rating it highly now based solely on user experience that it stays responsive and on track when need map navigation and there's no WIFI or cell network available. First Review: Really good offline navigation so I hate that I have to say goodbye to it but have you seen all the permissions it has? Offline, but wants my contacts and ""full network access"", to name just a few! Why? A lot of apps do this so it's not a surprise, but if they want permissions they shouldn't seem to need then I have to wonder why. Buying a navigation device for a couple of hundred might be cheaper than this free app, depending on what it is they do with all the permissions/access they're asking for here. Here's just some permissions (from their description) I have doubts about: find accounts on the device modify your contacts read your contacts run at startup view network connections full network access modify system settings connect and disconnect from Wi-Fi","en",1,"Hi Daniel, please see the following link if you have concerns about your privacy, this will provide reassurance at how your data is handled: https://bit.ly/30iNN0e ^Conor"

First the good: I really like the routing algorithms and profile options. So far, better than most others I've tried. But that is about where it ends. The bad: Map display is awful, and almost useless in non-nav (map only) mode. Local streets do not show up unless zoomed really close, and even then, almost invisible with white-on-light gray background! Having to tap the screen to activate zoom (+-) buttons is a pain. Autozoom feature doesn't seem to work, it is either too close in or too far out. Needs a 'zoom to next turn' option. Hoping this is a bug and can be fixed. *Edit: Since I've been unable to duplicate the subscription verification problem I had while traveling off-line, I've deleted that comment. Still has me concerned though. Another problem I would add is that there is no search option for contacts. I have several hundred contacts on my phone, and it is nearly impossible to scroll through to find the one address I need. For U.S. users, you need to add regional map download options, maybe 4-6 regions at most.

Has some idiosyncrasies that are annoying, however. For example, in many Urban settings it only tells you every other or every third cross street. When you're simply looking for a certain turn or intersection this can be an extremely annoying omission. We were a little annoyed with the route planning algorithms when trying to drive through Portland Oregon recently. No matter whether we chose the shortest route, or the fastest route, it seems we got either a bunch of turn offs that were unnecessary, or it dragged us off the interstate onto a bunch of side streets just to make sure we were going the shortest distance. It needs to have some option for, perhaps, the simplest route. When you're pulling a trailer you don't want to be exiting and entering a freeway repeatedly, or driving around on a bunch of tiny surface streets. Lastly, I would really like to see an option for displaying your elevation as you're traveling. That's another handy feature when you're dragging a trailer up a long grade. It can be helpful to know how close to the summit you actually are.","en",1,"Ken, thanks for this thorough and insightful review of the app!

Instructions are clear and timely. Massively let down by several really annoying niggles and two main issues: 1) it puts you on long circuitous routes because it thinks it will save you a few minutes but the route is actually slower because the roads are so narrow; and 2) the traffic information is awful. It doesn't show big delays on major routes that have been there for days. It underestimates delay time by about 20%.","en",19,"Hi there Ben

Thanks for your review. We're glad to hear that you are enjoying the interface of the app, as well as voice instructions.

To adapt the routing to suit you, you can go to the Settings Menu, then Route Planning. This way you can change between 'fastest', 'shortest' and more.

Hopefully future updates will broaden the app to handle HSP & HFP. A really superior Sat Nav at a reasonable price, sadly let down by its inability to route the navigation instructions through the car audio via Bluetooth (except through the media channel which rules out listening to the radio or cd if you're wanting your directions). I'll keep using it because it is so good as a Sat Nav and maybe, one day, they'll fix the audio channels.","en",3,"Hi - thanks for posting this review. Nice to hear that you like the app.

The app streams audio via BlueTooth using the A2DP profile. There is also HSP and HFP which it does not use

I have moved from my Tomtom Via navigation system to this app. The GPS navigation on the Go app is spot on and very easy to use. The only challenge is that, even fixed cameras require me to be online, something which is not the case with my Tomtom Via system. My Via system has these functions without the need to be online.

Just bought a panel van for a campervan conversion and it has really highlighted both the great features of this app but also some of it's annoying limitations. The live traffic is I have grown used to in the car is great, however not having the correct speed limits for a van when calculating routes or for speed warnings is a pain. I wouldn't be happy buying a dedicated commercial vehicle device to join both this and the feature stripped TomTom device because you can't have 2 bluetooth devices playing through the audio system at the same time so it would be navigation or music rather than both.  Vehicle size limits would be another useful paid service. The sooner TomTom realise that it's standalone devices sell predominantly to an ageing and shrinking market and become a software rather than hardware supplier the better.  More routing options other than fastest, eco, shortest. give sliders to allow us to find a balance between fastest and shortest rather than just one or the other. Allow us to input a user max speed that we don't want to travel over. Make these features paid optional extras if you must.  Do it soon or someone else will.","en",1,"Hi Doug - thanks for taking the time to leave this review. We're glad you like the live traffic in the app!

Go Mobile has been designed primarily for use in cars - for such specialized use as camper/caravan, we created the stand-alone Go Camper range of devices. You can enter vehicle dimensions on these and be routed accordingly

Seems like small things like take 2nd exit on the rotation is making issues and longer words like take on the highway exit 18 is working fine.  Specially on busy streets and insite city's it's not working properly the TomTom voice.  I've payed yesterday the € 20,00 for unlimited km's, further the application is working fine. If TomTom can fix the voice issues will be great!","en",0,"Hi & thanks for confirming the make & model of your in-car navigation unit.

It may be that antivirus apps have an effect on downloading maps on your phone. This is dependent on the app(s) installed and the mobile phone, not the Go Mobile app itself.

Just so you know, you can navigate to a town / city centre without needing a specific address.

Indeed, as this app is for offline navigation you will need to download a map to your phone. You can always download a map to an SD card if there is not enough internal space on the phone itself.

Some regions do have map 'zones' for specific countries, others do not. You can check the maps in the Settings menu of the app

Thanks for taking the time to review the app. Sorry to hear of your frustration with the subscription model.

The app can be used free for 50 m / 75 km per month, after which you can pay for more usage. This is mentioned in the description of the app - the price costs offline world maps, traffic, speed cams & more!

Is actually worse than the app I bought that was a one time purchase, now you have to keep paying. So much for a 'free' upgrade from the original app... Such a shame, TomTom used to be great, now they are just milking it. £14 a year... sounds cheap, but it adds up over time, and as it is now, for ever. You would think the price would have dropped over time, as everyone subscribed, but no, all they want is more... well, no more from me. Thanks though, for many years (15?) of great navigation. There are so many other 'free' apps these days, with IQ route equivalent routing, traffic, speed cameras and map updates.... so I guess I'll find a new driving pal. I would give Zero stars for tricking me into the 'upgrade,' but you can only give one as a minimum. ** UPDATE ** Thanks for the response. I still think it's expensive when there are FREE apps now with maps, just as good, and traffic etc. I don't mind (indeed I have) paying, just not over and over. I'd used TOMTOM since the 2000's, 20years plus, must have bought it a dozen times for different platforms. But these days, it doesn't look so good (Mono colour maps?!), and there are really no 'new' features. So that's £14 for minor map updates (Which everyone else gives for free) and traffic (Which every one else seems to be able to do either for free or much smaller cost), I liked TOMTOM, I used to always promote it to everyone. It's routing is sensible and reliable, and IQ routes is clever. But I refuse to keep paying chunks of money for a product that is basically in maintenance. Especially when I thought I had bought it outright several times already!","en",0,"Hi James - we understand you don't like the subscription system compared to 2009 app. In regards to features, Go Mobile adds the saving of routes, MyDrive functionality, extra search options, plus Traffic & Cams are part of subscription cost - with old app this was bought separately.

Thanks for posting this review. We’ve recently seen a number of requests to integrate the TomTom GO Mobile app with Android Auto. Currently in most markets, Android Auto only works with Google Maps and Waze. As a result, we cannot develop this feature until support for integration with TomTom is available.

For an entire week I try the standard Google Maps, Waze, then GoPilot, Mapquest, Navi, and some others.  The gap between the competition has slimmed a lot this year.  TomTom has done little in what I seen in added functionality or fixes.  The biggest thing that sets this GPS apart is the ever changing traffic meter.   There are two other apps that I know that have this but doesn't offer much detail and neither suggest new routes with new bad traffic ahead.  I'm changing my review to 4 stars instead of 5.  The gap between the competition is slim.   I think the UI is still clunky from the days of hardware GPS.  Searching for places is not very good and get addresses from your contacts seems to never work.  I also question their map routing.

Thanks for posting this review. We're glad you like using the app for some journeys.

Our Traffic service can't accurately predict what traffic's going to be like 30 minutes, as congestion is ever-changing, minute by minute

The mapping does , however, make use of IQ Routes, for congestion estimation:

Go Mobile does indeed feature Speed Camera alerts, but as with the Speed Cameras App, you will need to have your phone connected to a mobile data network to be notified of cameras.

If you have noticed some lag with the app, I recommend uninstalling then reinstalling the app - this should help.

Paid a while a go for full access on the days of windows mobile with no monthly or yearly subscription, now my account on Android says i can only drive limited miles, forcing me to upgrade to a yearly subscription!!  This company ignored Android for so long and favoured its rival operating system. After added pressure due to the size of Android, TOM TOM decided to create this app and decided to make people pay for ever!!. In the early days this app was an half hearted attempt to get it into Android compared to the same app on its rival operating system. It has got a lot better over time. However, I refuse to pay for subscription!! I have decided to go for CO PILOT, which in my honest opinion is a lot better and it's a one off payment for the app.","en",3,"Hi there, thanks for updating your review.

On one hand it's amazing how its the only satnav app I have used that is so up-to date with respect to new housing developments. Vital in the job that I do, seems to know about them long before other navigation apps. Then on the other hand, the navigation side is loopy. I constantly get instruction like ""go around the roundabout..."" then nothing until I have already picked a lane then it decided's to repeat again but this time ""go around the roundabout, second exit"" by that time it's to late. Take the exit is another classic as well when on a duel carriage way, but doesn't' say what exit so quick glance at screen is needed so you don't exit to early as it tells you way to early. (wouldn't be a problem if I knew what exit) Now onto a bigger problem, why am I constantly being taken down roads that have been closed for years due to a bypass being made. And trying to take me down roads that are no entry. Other satnavs and apps I don't have this problem with. They are also not new restrictions, been in place for many many years. Not sure if my problems are by design or if they are known about. *EDIT* Most my problems were caused by an incompatible voice being selected, once put back to Serena solved most of the issues. I still have problems with the app trying to take me down permanently closed roads etc Reporting map errors never gets them fixed, like TomTom just ignore them. I would like an option to avoid selected roads, for example avoid Fore Street so you won't be routed down that road. On the whole this is a very good app.","en",0,"Hi there!

other gps apps when it comes to intuitiveness and features. For instance in

available to speak the address or type. Another thing is when I want to 
look through the roads on my route Tom tom does not work it just goes. No 
scrolling in and out or looking at directions. Google maps has this 
feature. Also having the address on your current route would be nice. As I 
said though it is extremely accurate! So I use it generally only when the 
others cant find something.","en",0,"Hi there! Thanks for your informative review and feedback - we really appreciate this!

Excellent app! I've tried Garmin, Sygic and Copilot but Tomtom has always 
been my favourite, I've been using Tomtom sat-navs for 10 years or more

powerful and feature loaded user interface. I also like the way your 
contacts with address show up on the map. My only criticism would be that 
you can't purchase a lifetime subscription and that I believe the

We give the options of installing western Europe or installing each country so that customers with little device memory can still use it. The map size is reflective of how detailed our maps are.

The maps are not over cluttered with too much information. Speed camera locations are accurate and like that you can report mobile speed cameras. Would be handy to be able to add other alerts like Waze. The main gripe I have is to do with up coming turn information. Other apps will let you know a long way ahead which street or exit you need to take but TomTom will say you need to turn left or right in X km but does not say which exit to take until closer and then it can be too late to get through congested traffic to get into the correct lane. This can be a problem on a busy freeway with exits close together.","en",1,"Hey Scott,

This is not normal behavior for the app. Firstly, please make sure your phone is getting a good GPS signal by using an app such as 'GPS Status & Toolbox'.

It may be necessary to uninstall and reinstall the app, deleting the cache while doing so. That should sort it - if not, just get back in touch.

Evaluated Google Maps, Waze and this TomTom app. In my opinion TomTom maps are the best. Lane guidance is awesome, especially in complicated metro areas.   Google and Waze concern me when driving and losing cell tower connectivity. In those situations they keep working fine but if you need to start from such a place you are out of luck.   Waze eats a lot of battery even when phone is plugged in battery level kept dropping.  Between lost connections and the way it communicates back and forth it eats a lot of power. It also tends to pick some really bad routes. 25 min trip can take an hour.

Quite responsive. Easy to read and just the right amount of uncomplicated.  I use it on a Samsung S3 and a Tab S.  I thought the design was so brilliant, I wanted to pay the annual fee (which I think is reasonable).  I'm a single mom.  For me to want to pay anything says a lot.  But, this much hard work and good design deserves compensation.  Google used to go nuts on me with their offline maps.  It also decides at random to stop giving street names. Garmin ViaGo left me trying to figure out new to me places on my own repeatedly.  So did Sygic.  I have a GPS app called Offline Maps that does things I don't understand.   Kept putting up a map of Kentucky, and I'm in PA   Waze was psycho.  Took me routes that were miles out of the way. Froze constantly.  I liked it, but it didn't like me back.  I don't use my cell data, it's very limited.  With that in mind, TomTom is far more reliable. (Satellite?)  My one suggestion.  The Saved Places.  It would be very nice to have folders.  I'd love to be able to put things in categories.  I also wish there was a way to choose if a star ends up on your map from a Saved Place.  I don't want to see my Wasband's house when I'm having a good day.  Or when I'm having a bad one either, come to think of it.","en",1,"Pati, thanks for this in-depth review of GO Mobile.

Can't even use it because the ""lifetime maps"" don't even fit anymore. I figured I'd take a look at the TomTom app just out of curiosity. With this app you only get 50 miles free. But the ABSOLUTE worst offense this app commits, is that you have to pay $21 PER YEAR to drive an unlimited number of miles. You have to have balls the size of an elephant's to have the nerve to charge per year just to use an app for navigation in a world where Google Maps, Apple Maps, Waze, and Sygic exist. I could see MAYBE paying $10 or $15 for lifetime map traffic updates, but to charge purely for use, then for extras is an awful business model. Sure you may have a few thousand (I'm sure it's more) customers willing to do that, but you can make a lot more revenue by giving away unlimited miles and just having traffic a paid option. Either way, if anyone is looking for a great maps app, just stick to Google Maps and download offline maps (for free).","en",2,"Hi there, The app is free to download and use for the first 50 miles each month as a trial period.

age, being able to choose should be a basic feature users are entitled to. 
One star lost because of this. The other thing fans of the traditional 
TomTom sat navs won't like is the wording of voice comands. The traditional 
device would usually be like: ""turn right at the roundabout, third exit."" 
This app says ""go around the roundabout, third exit."" I cannot recall the 
exact wording, but the 'turn left/right/cross' part was certainly missing. 
Even then, the exit number was wrong, I found a number of times. Both these 
just confuse people. That ""turn right"" is quite important for me. Another 
star lost because of this. The simple instructions given verbally is what I 
like(d) about TomTom and what made me try this app. Unfortunately it's not

Especially that data is becoming cheaper and cheaper and we can also roam around Europe without paying roaming charges.  I have been a TomTom user for many years, going from the bulky devices, to the sofware on Windows Mobile and then running TomTom Go for a couple of years.  But Google Maps just blows it away. Type in Lunch, it finds lunch Spots, with reviews, photos, menus opening times etc, then click navigate and off you go, automatically re-routing through congestion and closed roads.   TomTom, nope. the POI database is a joke. It never finds anything, the new Go interface is horrendous. I was using google maps to find what i wanted, then going back to TomTom Go findint he location manually and navigating it.  The navigation itself works fine. The only feature this does have over Google Maps is it displays the current speed limit of the road which can be very useful.  But alas, I think I will be uninstalling TomTom Go.

Road without warning. This wasn't a problem for me as I knew it was there 
and there are Road Signs that drivers should be aware of, but I know this 
is a feature that many people would like. 2) The spoken navigation was too 
quiet for the intended purpose (I didn't have the radio on or the fan, and 
was travelling alone so it was quiet in my car but I still found some 
verbal directions hard to hear. And finally, and this is being pedantic, 
but at a roundabout, the spoken instruction always advised ""go across the 
Roundabout"" regardless of what exit you are taking. Fine in many 
circumstances, but gets confusing when you keep being told ""go across the 
Roundabout and take the first exit"". Overall a good App, certainly better 
than another map commonly used for directions/route planning operated by a

We've just spent 10 days in France and after the first few days using this app I had to return to run Google maps alongside it to double check its routing. It all began at out arrival at our destination village and, rather than directing us through the town to the hotel, it tried to route us through a factory's security guarded gate and grounds. We asked it to offer an alternative and this took us 2 km out of the village, around the countryside and back in the opposite side rather than through the middle...so much for Shortest Route. Other issues included setting the destination as a petrol station with cheap petrol just off the motorway. The tracking took us off the motorway, around a roundabout and back onto the motorway thus avoiding the petrolstation and costing us significantly more at a motorway station further on. All in all, the £4.99 I paid for a month's subscription has ended up costing us over £100 on petrol costs. Avoid.","en",0,"Hey Ryan ,

through rather than just waiting that extra minute; let alone waiting would 
save fuel. Oh and it would be good if you also asked what sort of vehicle 
does the user have: a bike, car, van or bigger. This would also help 
determine whether the tiny roads is a good choice. But everything else

Really love it, the convenience of having traffic and clear directions on my phone without having to set up my dedicated sat nav each time I drive. My only gripe is I don't get the Voice directions even though I have turned up the volume to max. It only appears at the beginning to say how long the journey would take then nothing happens afterwards , just silence Update: Got yearly subscription now. The voice issue was because I was not using the right Bluetooth sync from my mobile to my car unit (A2DP). Really rate this TT app especially after it got me home last night from motorway when I got lost using Google maps which suddenly changed the route direction north to south rather than forwards in the driving direction and it was easier to load TT than work out how to fix it whilst driving on the motorway. The guidance window at intersections are brilliant. Only gripe is at roundabouts it should indicate on the screen what the exit number is since one can miss the voice instruction and leave at wrong exit adding further time to journey. All this is important so as to get into the right lane at roundabout. If you could add the lane guidance Google map has for city roads this would be excellent. But as I say,  this got me out of a serious jam last night, hence top nav app now and would recommend to everyone","en",1,"Hi!

Thanks for leaving this review. I'm glad to see that you are enjoying the app.

But having an older model I had to pay for both map updates and services so the app was a logical choice. Test with free mileage was satisfying and I payed an upgrade :)   Update: I did around 4000km with this app this summer. 5 stars sure.  BUT!!! (i'll not withdraw a star because the app itself works flawless) the search in the app is a nightmare! Integrated google search in previous devices worked excellent...why did developers replaced it with awkward ""search in place, whole map, etc)? Bad move! The search is useless! One needs to find an address in google maps and copy-paste it to tom-tom app. Example: try to search for airport while being in the center of Budapest. You'll get a list of ""airports"" and now try to find a real one.  Please integrate a good old google search back...If i'll drop tom-tom that will be just because of useless search function...","en",0,"Hi Nikolai,

It sounds like your phone is not finding a valid GPS signal. The app relies on the GPS hardware in your phone to find an accurate location. Please download a GPS Status app and see if you are getting a GPS fix.

Otherwise most places don't show up on the map. Just go to TomTom's website to see how much detail their maps lack. Addresses, points of interests, speed limits, roads are anywhere from 2 to 10+ years out of date. Hardly anything shows up while driving except for streets and gas stations.  A park that's 20+ years old doesn't even show up. Which would be OK if there was a satellite view, but it doesn't even have that feature. Now for the real deal killers. If you're traveling more than few states that are between their ""regional"" maps then you have to load the other map, and while that happens you can't use the app. The only other option is to use the huge maps that take up 6+ GB of space. Which today isn't so bad, but if you have an older phone, or an Apple/Google phone that doesn't take an SD Card then your only choice is to  upgrade your phone.  Also no easy way to adjust the sound level of the voice. You can change the audio channel and muck with that, but throw in bluetooth and it turns into a mess. There is no way to set a soft speed warning.

It's much cheaper than buying a motorcycle GPS. The windy route option helps you explore roads that I've never been too in my area. The only downside is if it can't find a windy road it'll turn a straight rode into a windy option by turning you off onto small access roads that loop back to the main road. It would be nice if their algorithm would stop doing that.  Another great feature unique to Tom Tom is the way it handles pre-made routes. It saves them as a track instead of using waypoints so if you miss a turn or decide to take a different road it doesn't obsess with taking you back to a specific waypoint. Instead, it will usually pick another route to get you back onto the main track. The routing is very intuitive. Thanks Tom Tom!","en",2,"Hi David,

Works well, but like the stand alone devices it has very poor support for user POIs, making the use of excellent 3rd party speed camera databases useless. A real backward step in adding POIs to the device and setting alarms compared to the old ""Home"" devices. Its own speed cameras are so far out of date to be a joke (UK), and as there are excellent alternatives out there that used to be supported, why they have ditched that support is anyone's guess. Live traffic is good, but if you can get an old TomTom device with Live services and full POI support, buy that instead and subscribe to a decent Speed camera POI database!  TomTom's reply below missed the point - this software is great, and the Live features are superb; I wouldn't expect old versions to be supported after so many years, but to see the custom POI feature with dedicated symbols and proximity warnings re-introduced to the new software would be a massive enhancement!","en",1,"Hi Steve,

Looked good but then we ended up going in circles around Warwick and it told us to take turns where there were none, eg right turn across barrier on a dual carriageway. Must have been partly loss of GPS, but the map clearly showed there was no turn when the voice said there was. Perhaps laggy. Ended up just following the signs the good old fashioned way. Also found some instructions confusing,eg. On a dual carriageway ""keep right and take the exit"" which of course is on the left! So we missed the exit. Maybe it meant ""take the exit then keep in the right hand lane"". Could be because I chose an Australian voice because it sounded more humorous - maybe that's how you say ""take the exit"" down under.","en",0,"Hey Neville,

Sorry to hear you had poor navigating experience with the app. It does sound as though there may have been a GPS loss which caused some direction confusion.

You get to use the app with 75 km free every month. You can use this as a trial to see if you like the app. If you need to travel further or use the app more, then you can buy a subscription.

All features (maps, traffic etc) are the same regardless of if you have paid or not.

In comparison to Waze/Google, GO just uses GPS for navigation, instead of mobile data. This means you can avoid data charges, especially when using it abroad.

There needs to be an option to avoid unnamed roads and narrow country lanes.  The 'avoid blocked road', 'find alternative route' and 'change speed limit' should be big buttons on the screen not in menus and the app should remain on top at all times.  When I use my hands free to call someone the phone screen overlays the directions and this has occasionally caused me to miss my turn and means I have to keep touching the screen to get navigation back on top.  Would be useful to see speed limits on the actual map so you can see ahead when the limit is changing rather than several seconds into the changed limit.  I have reported many speed limit changes but these never seem to be updated.  Colour schemes should be improved so that the destination line doesn't disappear into the distance making it hard to plan which lane to be in to complete a journey.

The app requires permissions for contacts so that you can navigate to those stored in your address book. The phone calls permission is so that the app can still work when you are on a call - otherwise certain functions like Voice Instructions would cause an issue.

It didn't work.    TT advise that if the app is reinstalled then the map and other data will be stored onto SD by default, provided there is sufficient storage available on the SD card.  I have 12GB free on SD and the map I want is 900MB,  but TT installs it onto the phone's internal storage.  Other apps offer the option of where to store during install, and/or allow the storage location to be changed in Android application manager.  Neither option is available with TT.  The nav is OK and the on route directions are good, but a major problem for me is that maps can't be stored on an SD card.  The maps are large (1GB) and I don't want them using up my precious storage.  Other nav apps allow maps to be stored on SD - please change.  Destination search for attractions and points of interest is a bit hit and miss - can't find them half the time - other apps do a much better job.  Customising a route is a real pain - need to be able to drag a route to an alternative, as for example can be done with Sygic GPS.","en",1,"Hi there, if you'd like to load the maps onto a SD card, please follow these steps: http://bit.ly/2srP1pY.

4729,"A Google user",2017-05-24,3," TomTom has been my go to navigation app for two years now.  Its clear instructions, fairly reliable traffic and low data use are difficult to beat. It is mostly possible.  The occasional traffic outages are very anoying and seem to take ages to be resolved if they occur on weekends, just when you need traffic.  Some speed limits are also wrong.  However the biggest problem is updates.  Because the app needs additional downloads to work these must be downloaded after an update, but you only find out when you start the app, which is usually in the car, with no wifi.   The app is then useless until you have time to update it.  But if you do start the app straight after an update the TomTom servers seem to be overloaded and the download fails.  The latest update was a complete failure and I had to re download the app. It failed to start and so i left it until this evening. I had to clear out the cache to get it to start up and then it needed to download the maps.   I like this app and I missed it today, but this is not usability.  In response to TomTom. I am referring to the app updates.  By the way traffic is not working this evening.","en",1,"Hey there! Thanks for the update.

When I run short of space it will be the first to go!             Update 1:  After email exchange with TomTom support and a lot of testing, the problem only occurs if the SD card is formatted as Internal Storage.  If formatted as Portable, then it works as per TT instructions.  Unfortunately this does not help me so hopefully there will be a future fix.                  Update 2:  Another issue is that there is no sound from the app if the phone is connected via Bluetooth in the car.  To be accurate, the sound is routed via Media BT and not Phone BT so you can hear the sat nav  sound if you set your car's audio input to be the phone.  This means if you pair the phone so you can receive calls hands-free, then you can't listen to the radio and also hear sat Nav sound.  Ideally I would want output to be like a Phone call so Sat Nav instructions cause whatever is playing to fade for the duration.  Apparently other apps do this, but not TomTom GO (yet)","en",1,"Hey Carl, sorry to hear about the issue with your SD card and with the Bluetooth sound settings. We do not yet have a fix for the Bluetooth settings as, like you stated, it is done through Media instead of phone.

The app has some really good features like being able to download maps, speed camera notification and what the the speed limit of a road (but often incorrect). Sounds silly but the path to take is boldly highlighted also and that isn't the case in some apps (very important for a new driver like me)  The app however fails on some basics. In the desire to keep the main screen clutter free, it means more clicks to get to basic things like searching. It's also really confusing. Generally panning around the map to look for something is a terrible experience. I use GMaps and come back to this if need be. When you're searching to go to your local Tesco, it's so much more confusing with this app than for example Google Maps and it tells me nearest one is 1 mile away when in fact it's right behind my house. It's not bad if I have an address but terrible at doing its own searches. Turn by turn directions aren't as great as GMaps - it tells me to bear left rather than directly telling me to use the first or second lane as GMaps does - find that much clearer. Many more issues but I'll leave it there.  Just discovered Waze and although it seems to be a data hog, it does the things I like about TomTom with less of the issues so might be moving there.","en",1,NA

Sometimes it is an overkill when the detour is going thru small roads, driving a longer distance instead of staying motorway with some traffic and reaching at the sametime. I had informed the customer service that app looses my location  quite often while driving and it starts to recalculate. They told me to reinstall the app again but it did not solve the issue fully. I read on the forum, to turn off location services, restart the phone and re-enable the location services again. It appears GPS has improved but still have issue when the car is not moving. It would be better if alternative routes with estimated time are visible on screen instead of finding it thru' menu (See Google Maps feature).

Old TomTom navigation app had worked off-grid, this one according to TomTom support will not work when you have no cell phone connectivity. So why exactly you would pay for this app?  Because it gives you all the convenience of the FREE Google Maps for small monthly fee?  UPDATE: I got this app as an upgrade, and my initial understanding wasn't correct. App indeed does work off-line for routing, it is just some features don't work. How does it compare to original app? is it better? yes and no. In some aspects it is definitely better than an old one, in some it is worse and in many it is down to your preference. The TomTom-GPS like interface is gone, with easy to read side bar speed information, the old easy to see colors are gone too. It is more mainstream now.  So in what aspects it is better? Search is much better (old app couldn't find many POI), routing via points is easier.

In the car this wouldn't be an issue but I use the app for my motorcycle commute so I've had to pull over to restart it. That has cost you 1 star.

Simple idea would be to allow the user to set minimum speeds for road types.","en",0,"Hello Robin, We are sorry to see that you have encountered a problem upgrading your app. Typically all that needs to be done is the Restore which you mentioned.

Displays gas stations along your route, and with 2 button press, it shows ALL the gas stations (not just on your route, but in the area).  It can search and find all sorts of POI's (Points of Interest).  It zooms into turns, it helps by telling you which way to turn AFTER the turn (before you start turn 1), tells you things like, ""turn left on 3rd street"", reads street names, which side of the street your destination is on. Shows & warns for speed limits, traffic cams, alerts to traffic, has 3d pics of which lane to be on for highway exits / turns).  The menu is large and easy to use (safe and good when driving).  & Customizeable.    Other GPS apps had many of these same features, but didn't work as smoothly or as reliable as Tom Tom.

Also, it randomly abandoned navigation forcing me to set up the journey again (while trying to keep up with the traffic).  - On the few minutes that it worked, took too long to announce turns and the refresh rate was really slow ( so I missed a couple of turns which put me into a mess ).  - Downloaded a voice and guess what? Didn't worked out, it keep using the default one.  In the end I used waze (free, faster, more accurate,) and it made the trick, got me out of mexico city real quick.

Glad to hear you were getting on well with the app. Sorry that it's not suited your needs after the trial miles - it's worth noting that GO Mobile just uses the GPS on your phone for navigation, instead of mobile data. This means you can avoid data charges, especially when using it abroad.

(It's not actually a pause, because it will always go back to the beginning when it resumes, so I could never get beyond 3%.)  Saw there are several mentions of this same issue in the Play Store reviews and Tom Tom forums going back months. I tried the suggestion of uninstalling the app, clearing Play Store caches, and then re-installing it. However it misbehaved just the same. SO if Tom Tom haven't been able to fix it by now I'm not going to waste any more of my time.  I'll try an alternative GPS app.  Additional comment following TomTom's comment of earlier on 22nd May.:-  my phone is a Moto-G v1 and has no SD card because it doesn't have a slot for one.  Therefore it is installed on to internal storage.","en",0,"Thank you for the update, Jim. We are sorry to hear that this still isn't working out for you.

Indeed, you can use the app with 75 free km per month. After that there is a subscription cost. Even the free use of the app includes World Maps, Traffic & Speed Cameras, as well as navigation based on GPS instead of Mobile Data.

However, my main issue at the moment is it will not load maps to sd card no matter what Tom tom say I have 200gb free on my sd card but it still sends the maps to internal memory. Their solution sucks I am not about to reformat and back up 200gb. I could root my very expensive flagship phone and edit the file pointing to internal memory but there is a risk to the phone warranty. The correct solution is to go back to Navigon and give up on Tomtom. Your old version was better than Navigon but your Go version is very inferior Note I have an S7 Edge an HTC 10 and an LG G5 all have at least 128gb sd cards from new and all have the maps loaded to internal memory including the HTC10 which is set for adaptive memory but TomTom still managed to load to its internal memory and ignored the SD card. so this is not a one off.
